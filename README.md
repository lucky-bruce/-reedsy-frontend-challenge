## 2. General
##### 2.1 What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?
I enjoy working on all kind of front end projects. Front-end technology is evolving very fast and thus there are always so many challenges. <br>  
  
##### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?
I like the elegant code style in html5. I can use tags like `section`, `nav`, `header`, `footer` etc and it makes html code more clear and easy to understand.<br>
Actually, I use all of them in all my projects.

##### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement.
Simply, innerHTML clears everything and makes a new dom but createElement makes a new one. <br>
There are some useful cases for both of them.

##### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
Using two-way data binding, we can make a model value reflected directly to its matching view and vice-versa. <br>
One-way data flow is directly related with single source of true concept.<br>
In one-way data flow data only flows from model to the view. <br>
Generally, the model is a mutable object and cannot be modified directly. <br>
One way data flows are deterministic, whereas two-way binding can cause side-effects which are harder to follow and understand.

##### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?
 Imo, generally javascript is mainly used in frontend and backend programming recently. <br>
 In web programming, there are always request and responses that take some time and we have to prevent our system to be hanged and they must be processed in background showing the progress. <br>
 Without the asynchronous feature, it makes UX worse.
